TO DO:

GAME FEATURES/REFACTOR:
- Extract WeaponSystem (multi-shot, spread, cooldowns)
- Extract EnemyAISystem (smarter enemies, variety, bosses)
- Juice & feel (screen shake, hit stop, sound hooks)
- Add damage events & modifiers
- Visuals (sprites? Pixels? Backgrounds? Generate or static?)

Game:
Claws on the Course
A Disc Golf Survival Game

Identity:

Game Ideals:
The player never feels safe
The player never feels hopeless
Every upgrade feels like relief, not dominance
“One or two good choices away” is the emotional loop
That demands gradual scaling and controlled progression pacing.

Future Evolutions:
📊 Stat Mapping (Fits Your Current Code)
Disc	Speed	Damage	Fire Rate	Feel
Putter	Low	Low	High	Control
Mid	Medium	Medium	Medium	Balance
Fairway	High	High	Medium	Power
Distance	Very High	Very High	Lower	Burst

First BIG refactor:


1️⃣ Time-Based Enemy Scaling (Pressure Backbone)

Goal:

Difficulty increases subtly over time, independent of player level.

Decisions locked

Scaling is gradual

Scaling is based on run time

Player should feel it over time, not minute-to-minute

Action plan

Introduce a single difficultyMultiplier based on runTime

Apply it on enemy spawn only

Scale HP strongly, speed lightly

✅ No spikes
✅ No level-based scaling
❌ No enemy damage scaling (yet)

2️⃣ XP & Leveling Scaling (Pacing the Arms Race)

Goal:
Upgrades arrive just slightly slower than difficulty increases.

Decisions locked

XP requirements scale with time, not level

XP drops stay flat (for now)

Player is always “almost keeping up”

Action plan

Scale xpToLevel using run time

Ensure XP curve grows slower than difficulty

Reset cleanly on new run

✅ Prevents over-leveling
✅ Preserves “one upgrade away” feeling
❌ No XP drop scaling yet

3️⃣ Enemy Speed Exploit Fix (Non-Negotiable)

Goal:
Enemies are never allowed to stop being a threat.

Decisions locked

Enemy slow can exist

Enemy speed must have a hard floor

AFK builds must die

Action plan

Define base enemy speed

Clamp modified speed to ≥ ~50% of base

Apply clamp after all modifiers

✅ Slows still feel good
❌ Enemies never stop moving

4️⃣ Upgrade Philosophy (What Upgrades Are Allowed to Do)

Goal:
Upgrades help the player manage pressure, not remove it.

Decisions locked

Upgrades may:

Improve control

Improve survivability

Improve efficiency

Upgrades may not:

Remove enemy threat entirely

Stack infinitely without friction

Solve the game on their own

Action plan

Keep upgrade list small and intentional

Reduce magnitude of flat stat increases

Add soft limits (rarity, caps, diminishing impact)

❌ No tradeoffs yet
❌ No evolutions yet
❌ No scaling upgrades with time

5️⃣ Problematic Upgrades (Immediate Handling)

Goal:
Remove or neutralize dominant strategies.

Decisions locked

Flat enemy speed reduction is dangerous

Large flat damage jumps are dangerous

XP multiplier fights time-based scaling

Action plan

Rework enemy slow into situational / temporary

Reduce damage upgrade increments

Cap or de-emphasize XP multiplier

✅ Builds remain viable
❌ Builds never become dominant

6️⃣ Numbers & Early Game Feel (Baseline Sanity)

Goal:
Early game feels fair, readable, and engaging.

Decisions locked

Enemies take ~2 hits early

Player is pressured but not overwhelmed

First few upgrades feel impactful but not explosive

Action plan

Re-evaluate base damage vs base enemy HP

Reduce early upgrade magnitudes

Test early game without touching scaling constants

🚦 IMPLEMENTATION ORDER (DO NOT MIX)

This order matters.

Phase 1 — Scaling Backbone

Add difficulty multiplier

Apply enemy HP & speed scaling

Add XP scaling

Phase 2 — Exploit Fixes

Clamp enemy speed

Adjust damage upgrade size

Phase 3 — Upgrade Cleanup

Remove / rework enemy slow

Cap or adjust XP multiplier

Limit repeat upgrades

Only move forward when the previous phase feels right.
